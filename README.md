# 3D Shape
____

1. Abstract Base Class - Shape3D
Defined an abstract base class named Shape3D using Python’s abc module.

It includes two abstract methods:
- surface_area() → returns the surface area of the shape.
- volume() → returns the volume of the shape.

2. 3D Shape Subclasses
Implemented the surface_area() and volume() methods using appropriate mathematical formulas.
Provided a constructor for each of the subclasses.

1. Sphere
2. Cylinder
3. Cube

3. Random Shape Objects
Created a list of 10 random Shape3D objects.
Randomly choosing the shape type: Sphere, Cylinder, or Cube.
Generated random dimensions using Python’s random module:
Radius: 1–10
Height: 5–20
Side length: 1–10

4. Output Information
For each shape in the list displayed:
- the name of the shape.
- its surface area.
- its volume.
This will demonstrate how abstraction and polymorphism allow treating different shapes through the same abstract interface.

6. How to run the code?
Just run the main.py, and it will automatically calculate 10 random shapes' surface area and volume.
